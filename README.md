# 📝 NotesLocker

**NotesLocker** is a secure and simple note-taking web app built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, view, and delete notes — all stored locally in the browser using `localStorage`.

## 🚀 Features

- ✍️ Add notes with a **title**, **content**, and **password**.
- 🔐 Password-protected note access — only those with the correct password can view a note.
- 🗑️ Delete notes when no longer needed.
- 🔎 Real-time search through your saved notes.
- 📅 Each note is timestamped with the date of creation.
- 📦 No backend or database required — everything runs in the browser.

## 🛠️ Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with Bootstrap for styling)
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS + LocalStorage)
- No frameworks, libraries, or backend — just plain frontend magic.
